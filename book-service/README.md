# Book-service

### Spring 6, Spring Boot 3, R2DBC, WebFlux

_For testing purposes the service is deployed to the Render cloud: https://book-api-8zon.onrender.com. Note that if the
service is not requested for 15 minutes, it will be shut down. After that it will need about 1-2 minutes to start up
again. So, the first request only is expected to be slow!_
